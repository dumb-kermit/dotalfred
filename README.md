Welcome to the autistic hub of mine, dedicated to various upgrades aka pluggable addons -- themes, workflows etc -- to Alfred on MacOS, all made exclusively by ME.

HKEY LAUCNHER -- Poor man's rCMD, Keyknockr etc -- go CMD+CMD to get a list of currently running apps on your machine, press configured HK+number or click with a pointer, to switch to the selected app. Work's pretty much like rCMD and other switchers, except it is built by me, in Alfred and it is free.
